by using clinical variables

This project uses machine learning to predict the risk of heart disease based on clinical and lifestyle-related features. It applies supervised learning methods—particularly logistic regression and others—to draw insights and support healthcare decision-making.

# Dataset

- **Source**: Kaggle
- **Features**: Includes age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol, chest pain type, resting ECG, fasting blood sugar, and more.

# Project Structure

- `Heart_diseases_prediction_using_clinical_variables_.ipynb`: Main notebook with data loading, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

# Machine Learning Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical features
   - Feature scaling

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Correlation heatmap
   - Feature distribution plots

3. **Model Training**
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest
   - XGBoost

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Classification Report
   - ROC-AUC Curve

# Results

- Best Model: XGBoost
- Accuracy: 90%
- ROC-AUC: 0.94
